
# PromptCommand AI Agent

An AI-powered agent system that processes user prompts, executes commands, and returns intelligent results.  
This project is structured with separate **frontend** and **backend** components for modular development.


## 🚀 Features

- **AI Prompt Processing** – Handles natural language prompts.
- **Command Execution** – Runs backend-defined commands securely.
- **Modular Architecture** – Frontend and backend separated for flexibility.
- **Cross-Platform** – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Extensible** – Easy to add new commands or AI models.
